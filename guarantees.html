            <h2 class="section-title">1. Game Key Guarantee</h2>
            <p>
              All digital products purchased from <strong>HighPayoutRush.com</strong> come with a key activation assurance. This guarantees that your game key is genuine, valid, and redeemable on the specified platform (e.g., Steam, Epic Games, Battle.net).
            </p>
            <p>
              If you face any issues activating your key, please reach out to our support team promptly via the <a href="./contact.html">Contact</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">2. Refund Eligibility</h2>
            <p>
              Given the digital nature of our products, refunds are typically not offered once a game key has been delivered and activated. However, we evaluate refund requests individually if the product was not delivered or fails to activate.
            </p>
            <p>
              If an error occurs on our end (e.g., you receive an incorrect key), we will issue a full refund or provide a replacement at no extra charge.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">3. Refund Process</h2>
            <p>
              Upon approval of a refund, the credited amount will be returned within 5–14 business days, depending on your payment method. Refunds will be issued through the original payment method unless otherwise agreed.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">4. Game Swaps</h2>
            <p>
              To exchange a game for another title, contact our support team before activating the key. Swaps are only feasible if the key remains unused and the desired alternative is available in our stock.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">5. Get in Touch</h2>
            <p>
              For inquiries about guarantees, refunds, or key activation issues, please reach out to our support team through the <a href="./contact.html">Contact</a> page. Our team is here to assist you every day of the week.
