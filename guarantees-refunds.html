          <h2 class="subtitle-page">1. Game Key Assurance</h2>
          <p>
            Every digital item purchased from 
            <strong>PQuickTacticsPlay.com.com</strong> comes with a key
            activation guarantee. This ensures that your game key is authentic,
            valid, and redeemable on the intended platform (e.g., Steam, Epic Games, Battle.net).
          </p>
          <p>
            Should you face any problems activating your key, please reach out to our
            support team promptly through the
            <a href="./contacts-page.html">Contact</a> page.
          </p>

          <h2 class="subtitle-page">2. Refund Conditions</h2>
          <p>
            Given the digital nature of our products, refunds are typically not
            available after a game key has been delivered and redeemed.
            However, we evaluate refund requests individually if the product was not
            received or fails to activate.
          </p>
          <p>
            If an error on our end occurs (e.g., receiving an incorrect key), we will
            fully cover the cost of a refund or provide a replacement.
          </p>

          <h2 class="subtitle-page">3. Refund Procedure</h2>
          <p>
            Once a refund is authorized, the amount will be credited back within 5–14
            business days, depending on your payment method. Refunds will be processed
            using the original payment method, unless otherwise arranged.
          </p>

          <h2 class="subtitle-page">4. Game Swaps</h2>
          <p>
            To exchange a game for a different title, contact our support team prior to
            redeeming the key. Exchanges are possible only if the key remains unused and
            the desired replacement is in stock.
          </p>

          <h2 class="subtitle-page">5. Get in Touch</h2>
          <p>
            For any inquiries about guarantees, refunds, or key activation, please reach
            out to our support team via the
            <a href="./contacts-page.html">Contact</a> page.
